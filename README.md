## Kwik-E-Mart
Our experiments in the code camp were heavily guided by the "Micro Frontends in Action" 
book (see the example code on github <https://github.com/naltatis/micro-frontends-in-action-code>).

Three independent teams develop the online shop Kwik-E-Mart:
- Product detail page: <https://github.com/bal-code-camp-micro-frontend/kwik-e-detail>
- Product list incl. recommendations and search: <https://github.com/bal-code-camp-micro-frontend/kwik-e-list>
- Checkout incl. mini basket and add/remove buttons: <https://github.com/bal-code-camp-micro-frontend/kwik-e-checkout>   

The first approach was using direct links from list to the detail page. There was no 
checkout yet.  

### v1 Server Side Includes
:link: <https://kwik-e-mart-v1-ssi-proxy.apps.baloise.dev/>

- The list team exposes a recommendations fragment under /l/recommendations/:id
- The detail page includes recommendations via server side includes:
```
 <!--#include virtual="/l/recommendations/12" -->
```
We had to use a workaround to include the text in the dom using thymeleaf:
```
<div class="col s12" th:utext="${product.recommendationFragment}"></div>
```
- We use nginx to perform the ssi in the project <https://github.com/bal-code-camp-micro-frontend/kwik-e-proxy>
```
server {
  listen 8080;
  ssi on;

  location /healthz {
    return 200 'woop woop!';
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
  }

  location /l/ {
    proxy_pass  https://kwik-e-list.apps.baloise.dev;
  }
  location /d/ {
    proxy_pass  https://kwik-e-detail.apps.baloise.dev;
  }
  location /c/ {
    proxy_pass  https://kwik-e-checkout.apps.baloise.dev;
  }
  location / {
    root /opt/html;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
```      
With this configuration we can use the same url for all applications. 

### v2 Web Components
:link: <https://kwik-e-mart-v2-webcomponents-proxy.apps.baloise.dev/>

- Client-side composition with web components
- Performance improvement using ssi for the recommendations skeleton 
-
### v3 App Shell as Single Page Application with vanilla js
:link: <https://kwik-e-mart-v3-appshell-proxy.apps.baloise.dev/>

- Wrapped 3 developements as Webcomponents
- "Click Events" Urls propagation from single developements to upper App Shell issue: shadow dom hides the origin element of an event and returns it self
